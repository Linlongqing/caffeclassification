CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlib_glog.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "lib_glog",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "lib_glog" with any
  of the following names:

    lib_glogConfig.cmake
    lib_glog-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "lib_glog" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "lib_glog_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "lib_glog" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
